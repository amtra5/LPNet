---------------

About:

LPNet: A simple HTTP long polling server
LPClient: A class created by LPNet that represents a single client

---------------

LPNet:
Usage-
Dim server = New LPNet()
server.StartServer(port) - Starts a HTTP server on port, default 80
server.StopServer() - Stops the server
server.tblCLients - A hash table of current LPClient objects by GUID

Sending Messages-
'client is an instance of LPClient created by LPNet
client.ID - Returns the client GUID
client.SendMessage(ByVal data As String) - Send a message to the client

Events-
evtConnected(ByVal client As LPClient) - Triggered when a new client requests a GUID
evtReceived(ByVal client As LPClient, ByVal data As String) - Triggered when a client sends a message to the server

Setting up your client-
1. Request a GUID by making a HTTP request to http://<server IP>/new. Your GUID will be returned in the message body.
2. Sending a message to the server can be done by making a HTTP request to http://<server IP>/send/<your GUID>/<your message>. If it succeded, your message will be echoed back to you.
3. Waiting for a message from the server can be done by making a HTTP request to http://<server IP>/poll/<your GUID>. The server will respond when a message is ready for you. It is recommended to make another polling request as soon as the first one is completed.
4. To manually end your session, make a HTTP request to http://<server IP>/disconnect/<your GUID>. This is good practice, as it tells the server that you have quit.
